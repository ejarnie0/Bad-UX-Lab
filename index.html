                            The issue here is that the responsiveness is affecting the desktop version of their reservation page. 
                            Something is removed from the page so there is a large blank area in between the search bars and the map and information in the lower part of the page.

                            The issue I have here is that there is too much information on the screen. 
                            The animations are a bit visually overwhelming and the words loading in and bouncing around is irritating to see every time you scroll up and down.

                            The problem here is that the menu shown is just an image that you have to zoom in on. 
                            When you zoom in, the quality is bad and you can't read the menu items due to the quality of the image, and the fact they used an image instead of typing them out or using an svg.
